SHT Project KTH Master's Thesis

Abstract
Peripartum depression (PPD) is a mental health disorder which can affect women
during pregnancy until a year after giving birth. One of the greatest concerns during
the peripartum period is the presence of self-harm thoughts (SHT). Women with SHT,
as well as their children, appear to be at higher risk for long-term complications.
Previous studies have suggested distinct biomarker profiles for SHT, however, there
are still limited studies in the peripartum period. Therefore, this project aims to
identify biomarkers associated with SHT which have potential be used as additional
components of screening during the peripartum period.
The objective of this project is to analyze data from the BASIC study and identify
potential biological markers which may be associated with SHT. Data from women
voluntarily participating in the study in Uppsala during and after pregnancy has been
collected via the BASIC study since 2009. Primarily, data from patients displaying SHT
will be investigated for correlations with differential expression of various biological
markers compared with controls free from SHT symptoms.
To be completed within the framework of a KTH Masters Thesis, the project follows
a time plan with milestones to ensure timely completion. Throughout the project,
the author is supported by supervisors with expertise in the pertinent fields. This
project is seen as a valuable opportunity to gain both knowledge, and experience in how
scientific research is conducted, within the field of medical biotechnology and maternal
health.
